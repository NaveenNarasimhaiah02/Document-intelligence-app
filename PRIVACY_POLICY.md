# Privacy Policy for SmartScan

**Effective Date:** February 27, 2026

SmartScan ("we," "our," or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how SmartScan handles information through our mobile application.

## 1. Information Collection
**We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.**
- We do not require account creation.
- We do not track your location.
- We do not access your contacts.

## 2. On-Device Processing
All document processing happens locally on your device.
- **Image Processing:** When you scan a document, the image is processed using on-device OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technologies.
- **Data Extraction:** Information extracted from your documents (such as dates, amounts, or providers) is processed strictly within the application's local environment.
- **No External Servers:** No images, extracted text, or metadata are ever transmitted to or stored on external servers.

## 3. Data Storage and Security
- **Local Storage Only:** All scanned documents and extracted data are stored locally on your device using encrypted storage.
- **User Control:** You have full control over your data. Deleting a document within the app removes it from your device's local storage.

## 4. Third-Party Access
Because all processing is on-device and no data is transmitted externally, no third parties have access to your documents or information.

## 5. Permissions
SmartScan requires the following permissions to function:
- **Camera:** To photograph documents for scanning.
- **Storage/Media:** To save scanned documents and (optionally) import existing images for processing.

## 6. Contact Us
If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the repository's issue tracker.
