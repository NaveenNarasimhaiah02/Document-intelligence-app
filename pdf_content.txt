Assignment: AI Document Classifier Mobile App (Lite)
Objective
Build a mobile application that allows a user to capture or upload a document image, extract
text, classify the document, extract key metadata, and store it in a searchable library.
The app should be deployable to both Android and iOS (TestFlight or submission-ready).
Core Features (Must Have)
1. Upload Document
ΓùÅ Capture image using camera
ΓùÅ Select image from gallery
(Images only ΓÇö PDF support is not required)
2. OCR Processing
Extract text from the image using any approach (Google ML Kit, Tesseract, Vision API, or
similar).
3. Document Classification
Classify the document into one of the following categories:
ΓùÅ Invoice/Bill
ΓùÅ Prescription
ΓùÅ Lab Report
ΓùÅ ID Proof
ΓùÅ Insurance
ΓùÅ Other
4. Metadata Extraction
Extract the following fields (use "not found" if unavailable):
ΓùÅ document_date
ΓùÅ person_name
ΓùÅ provider_name
ΓùÅ document_number
ΓùÅ amount
5. Document Library
ΓùÅ List all uploaded documents
ΓùÅ Search by name/provider
ΓùÅ Filter by category
6. Document Detail Screen
ΓùÅ Preview image
ΓùÅ View extracted metadata
ΓùÅ Edit and save metadata
AI Requirement
You must implement at least one real AI or intelligent processing component (not fully mocked).
This can be:
ΓùÅ LLM-based classification
ΓùÅ Keyword or rule-based model
ΓùÅ Python microservice
ΓùÅ Any other reasonable approach
Deployment Requirement
Please provide proof of deployment:
Android
ΓùÅ Play Store Internal Testing link OR submission screenshot
iOS
ΓùÅ TestFlight build OR submission-ready build
Also include:
ΓùÅ Bundle/package name
ΓùÅ Version number
ΓùÅ Privacy policy link (simple page is fine)
Deliverables
Please submit the following:
1. GitHub repository
2. README including:
Γùï Setup instructions
Γùï Architecture overview
Γùï Explanation of AI approach
Γùï Trade-offs and future improvements
3. Short Loom/video walkthrough (3ΓÇô5 minutes)
4. Store deployment proof
Timeline
You will have 7 days from the time you start the assignment.
Evaluation Criteria
We will evaluate based on:
ΓùÅ Functionality and completeness
ΓùÅ Code quality and structure
ΓùÅ AI implementation approach
ΓùÅ User experience
ΓùÅ Deployment readiness
